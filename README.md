# Virtual Reality Ocean World Builder
Interactive VR underwater ocean environment with object creation, interaction, and locomotion. Developed in Unity.

* [Artstation Porfolio Link](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/J9dav0)
* Use the interactive VR UI with a laser pointer to spawn fish and dolphins that can gather into groups and swim underwater via animation.
* Spawn different types of rocks and use the VR controller to pick them up and freeze them in space (turn off gravity) to create rock enclosures or art.
* Spawn food (eg. watermelon) to feed the fish by attracting groups of them to swim around the piece of food.
* Ability to scale the size of fish, dolphins, rocks, food to a minimum and maximum size to customize the look of your ocean.
* Two different modes of locomotion, switch between flying around underwater to be able to go swimming with the fish, and teleportation.
